***What does the application do?***

My travel map application lets a user keep track of all the places they have travelled to or want to travel to

## User Stories

**User stories for my travel map application that I have achieved:**
- As a user, I want to be able to add a city as a pin on a global map and save it in a database
- As a user, I want to be able to add corresponding details about the visit to the city and save it in the database
- As a user, I want to be able to be able to click on each pin and have a popup show the corresponding details
- As a user, I want to be able to colour code the pin to mark a city as either a city that I've visited already (green) or want to visit (blue)
- As a user, I want to be able to see how long ago the city and its corresponding details were added

## Future
**User stories for my travel map application that I will attempt in the future (not yet implemented):**
- As a user, I want to be able to edit and delete each city and have those changes saved in the database
